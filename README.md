## Description

Basically I was tired of certain websites not having dark themes and so I painstakingly designed my own in order to save my eyes in dark situations

## Getting a Live CSS Modifier

In order to use this you need some sort of CSS injector that can run on your webpages to change the styles when you load the page

### Safari

For Safari I would recommend something like [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app/) which costs $2.99 on the Mac App Store but is by far the best solution I have seen. IF you dont feel like paying, consider using a different browser like Google Chrome.

### Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera

For these browsers, the best option is to get [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/) which is free and is a powerful browser extention that lets you change web styling.

## Usage

1. Go to the website that you want to change the CSS for
2. Copy the Custom CSS from the GitHub Repository
3. Paste it into your Live CSS Modifier
4. Enjoy
